1. Create an abstract class Shape that will have abstract methods:
                - calculateArea();
                - calculatePerimeter();
                - showArea()       // will print shape type and area
                - showPerimeter()  // will print shape type and perimeter
                **** Shape Type should be an ENUM
Create subclasses Rectangle and Circle of Shape class and implement abstract methods.
Create a class Square that extends class Rectangle.
Initialize all objects and print results.

Implement same exercise using interface Shape;

2. BookStore Project (use Interfaces and Abstract classes)
Define BookStore witch will provide the following actions:
                - getAllBooks, getBooksByGenre addBook, deleteBook, findBook, bookExists
Define a class that will implement BookStore interface. As data container use Map to store all Books from Store.
Define a class Book with following fields:
- genre (Fantasy, Horror, Detective, Action) as ENUM
- id  - random number from 1 - 1000
- name
- price

Initialize BookStore object.
Apply all actions of book store.
Add possibility to find all books with price in range [minPrice, maxPrice]
Add possibility to find all books of specific genre with price in range [minPrice, maxPrice]
    Custom exception
    unit test for all methods


3. Create a program example to explain the concepts of Generic class and interface.
