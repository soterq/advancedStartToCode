Here is a list of exercises to work with 1D Arrays (Vector) / 2D Arrays (Matrix) / ArrayList (List):

All you need to implement tasks:
1.	IDE: IntelliJ IDEA community edition
2.	Java JDK 1.8

Implement all this tasks using different types of arrays:
•	String[]
•	int[]
•	String[,]
•	int[,]
•	List<String>
•	List<Integer>

1. Initialize and print all elements of an array
2. Sort a integer/string array
3. Calculate sum values of an array and calculate the average value of array elements
4. Check if an array contains a specific value
5. Find the index of an array element
6. Remove a specific element from an array and insert an element (specific position) into an array
7. Copy an array by iterating the array
8. Find the maximum and minimum value of an array
9. Reverse an array of integer/string values
10. Find the duplicate values of an array of integer/string values
11. Find the common elements between two arrays (integer/string values)
12. Remove duplicate elements from an array
13. Find the number of even and odd integers in a given array of integers
14. Convert an array (vector) to ArrayList and to convert an ArrayList to an array (vector)
15. Find all pairs of two elements of a given integer array where sum of the two elements is equal to a given integer
    Sample array: [1,5,4,2,6,0] > Target value: 6
16. Cyclically rotate a given array clockwise/anticlockwise by one (or by specific step)
17. Remove a specific sub-array from an array.
18. Insert a specific sub-array in to an array.
19. Suppose that we create an array A of GameEntry objects, which has an integer
    scores field, and we clone A and store the result in an array B. If we then
    immediately set A [4].score equal to 550, what is the score value of the
    GameEntry object referenced by B[4]?
20. Write a short Java program that takes two arrays a and b of length n storing int
    values, and returns the dot product of a and b. That is, it returns an array c of
    length n such that c[i] = a[i] · b[i], for i = 0,… ,n − 1.
21. Calcuate the factorial (without recursion and with recursion) for each element from an integer array
    and print an array that will contains factorial result for each element from first array.
